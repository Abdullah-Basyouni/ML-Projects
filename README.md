# Machine Learning Projects 🚀

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Projects repository**!  
This repository contains all my **Machine Learning projects**, showcasing data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and visualization.  
Each project demonstrates hands-on experience in **Python**, **scikit-learn**, and other ML tools.

## Projects Overview

### 1️⃣ Heart Disease Prediction
- **Description:** Predicting heart disease using patient data.  
- **Techniques:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Data Preprocessing (Outlier Handling)  
- **Dataset:** [Heart Disease Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset)  
- **Key Results:**  
  - Logistic Regression: 81% Accuracy  
  - Random Forest: 98% Accuracy  
- **Folder/Branch:** `HeartDiseaseProject`  


## How to Run

### **Create a virtual environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv
# Activate the environment:
# Linux / Mac
source venv/bin/activate
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
```


3️⃣ Notes

All datasets are sourced from public Kaggle datasets.

Projects focus on data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

Small improvements in preprocessing or modeling can significantly affect performance.

Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
